LOADING_TIP_0;"Everything has a price... even your life!" -Forest Bandit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_1;"You'd better not be a Manhunter!" -Looter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_2;"I'm going to break your legs... nice and slow!" -Looter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_3;"Your money or your life." -Looter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_4;"We can do this the easy way, or the hard way..." -Mountain Bandit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_5;"Your money or your life!" -Mountain Bandit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_6;"We'll have our pay... or we'll have our fun." -Mountain Bandit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_7;"My men and I would like a word with you about your purse and your belongings." -Mountain Bandit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_8;"I will drink from your skull!" -Sea Raider;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_9;"That's a nice head you have on your shoulders." -Sea Raider;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_10;"Less talking! More raiding!" -Sea Raider;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_11;"Today the gods will decide your fate!" -Sea Raider;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_12;"My most humble apologies. It is sometimes hard to recognize folk amid the smoke and gloom here. I still cannot believe that I must make my home in such a place." -Alayen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_13;"I'm an engineer, specialized in the art of fortification. If you need a wall knocked down, I can do that, given enough time. If you need a wall built back up, I can do that too, although it will take longer and cost you more." -Artimenner;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_14;"So I'd be much obliged if a well-armed party heading out in the next few days could take me along." -Artimenner;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_15;"I am Baheshtur, son of Azabei, grandson of Badzan. Were you not a barbarian, you would likely know from my lineage ..." -Bahestur;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_16;"I will bide my time in Calradia, for a year or two, then return home when the Khan's men have forgotten. The Humyan will not forget, of course, but such is the price of honour." -Bahestur;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_17;"In the meantime, any opportunities to earn a living with my sword would be most welcome." -Bahestur;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_18;"I had a bit of a misunderstanding here in town about a horse that I found tied up outside the inn." -Borcha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_19;"But if I was with a larger group who could vouch for me, they might let it pass. I'd be very grateful to you." -Borcha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_20;"Says he'll have me horsewhipped. And something in me snapped. So I walked off my post." -Bunduk;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_21;"Now I'm here getting drunk, and the Devil take tomorrow." -Bunduk;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_22;"It was my bad luck to be born to a weak father who married me off to a drunken layabout who beat me." -Deshavi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_23;""But I do not count myself unlucky, stranger, no more than any other woman of Calradia, this fetid backwater, this dungheap among the nations, populated by apes and jackals." -Deshavi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_24;"My brother and I quarreled. I had drunk too much. He slapped me with his glove, and I spit him upon my sword... My own brother! My sword-arm was stained with the blood of my kin!" -Firentis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_25;"Do you believe there is hope for a man like me? Can I find the path of righteousness, or am I doomed to follow the demons that dwell inside of me?" -Firentis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_26;"I am by training a natural philosopher, but condemned by the jealousy of the thick-headed doctors of my university to make my living as an itinerant surgeon." -Jeremus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_27;"Such is the ignorance and ingratitude of mankind." -Jeremus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_28;"The lord of this castle is reluctant to place me under arrest, but I am anxious to move on elsewhere." -Jeremus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_29;"For 30 years I followed the armies of this land, selling them victuals and drink, watching their games of dice and finding them girls, and nary a denar was left in my purse at the end." -Katrin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_30;"It's no kind of life, victualling the armies." -Katrin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_31;"I've had a weakness for pretty things, and it's gotten me into trouble, you see." -Klethi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_32;"Unfortunately, my last employer's wife had a lovely amulet, of a kind I simply could not resist. She doesn't know it's missing, yet, but she might soon. So tell me, are you looking for helpers?" -Klethi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_33;"Very well. I do not mind. My name is Lezalit. I am the second son of the count of Geroia, of whom you have no doubt heard." -Lezalit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_34;"So, if you know of any commander who believes that his purpose is to win battles, rather than pamper his soldiers, I would be pleased if you directed me to him." -Lezalit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_35"... we were ambushed by a party of Khergit raiders who rode away with most of the horses and goods. And two days later, my own caravan guards ran away with the rest of what I had." -Marnid;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_36;"So here I am, no money and no way home." -Marnid;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_37;"I am from an old family in the northern lands, the daughter of a thane and also wife to one." -Matheld;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_38;"When I have enough gold to raise an army I shall go back and take what it is mine." -Matheld;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_39;"Then perhaps you will have heard of my steed, who cuts across the Calradian plains like a beam of moonlight? Or of my sword, a connoisseur of the blood of the highest-born princes of the land?" -Nizar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_40;"I am a warrior by profession. But perhaps you may also have heard of my prowess as a poet, who can move the iciest of maidens to swoon." -Nizar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_41;"Which reminds me -- somewhere out there in the city is a rather irate husband. I don't suppose you might consider helping me leave town?" -Nizar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_42;"Greetings. I am Rolf, son of Rolf, of the most ancient and puissant House of Rolf." -Rolf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_43;"But I am anxious to avoid any further trouble, so if you knew of any company of fighting men where I might enlist, I would be most grateful." -Rolf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_44;"I shall marry whom I want, when I want. Moreover, regardless of what my father might think, I am perfectly capable of taking care of myself." -Ymira;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_45;"I should perhaps join a band of gypsies, or perhaps a troop of mercenaries!" -Ymira;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_46;According to Lezalit, the Empire once ruled the whole of Calradia and held other territories outside of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_47;Bunduk will tell you about how the Empire had tribunes, who were the people's representatives under the emperor. Travellers will tell you about the claim different factions have to rule Calradia in the footsteps of the old emperors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_48;Calradia roughly means "ruled by the council" in old Slavic languages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_49;Geroia is a land located outside of Calradia, where some of the heroes hail from. Nothing more is known about this region than what little is mentioned by the heroes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_50;The icy realm of Jumne beyond the North Sea, also said to be the ancestral home of the Nords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
